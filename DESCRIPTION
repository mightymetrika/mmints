Description: Provides functions and modules to simplify the development of
    'shiny' applications, particularly those sharing statistical methods or
    simulation frameworks. Features include the functions postgresUI() and
    postgresServer() for persistent data storage using a 'PostgreSQL' database to
    enable applications to run and save simulation results. The package also offers
    data upload functionality through the csvUploadUI() and csvUploadServer()
    functions that allows users to upload data, view variables and their types,
    and edit variable types before fitting statistical models within the 'shiny'
    application. These tools aim to enhance efficiency and user interaction in
    'shiny'-based statistical and simulation applications.
