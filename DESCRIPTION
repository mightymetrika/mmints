Description: Sharing statistical methods or simulation frameworks through 'shiny'
    applications often requires workflows for handling data. To help save and
    display simulation results, the postgresUI() and postgresServer() functions
    in 'mmints' help with persistent data storage using a 'PostgreSQL' database.
    The 'mmints' package also offers data upload functionality through the
    csvUploadUI() and csvUploadServer() functions which allow users to upload
    data, view variables and their types, and edit variable types before fitting
    statistical models within the 'shiny' application. These tools aim to
    enhance efficiency and user interaction in 'shiny' based statistical and
    simulation applications.
